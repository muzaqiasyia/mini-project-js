          <h4>He is Sung Jin-Woo <span>(성진우).</span></h4>
          <p>Sung Jin-Woo (성진우) is the protagonist of Solo Leveling. He was previously known as the World's Weakest Hunter and delved down the path of becoming the World's Strongest Hunter after he was Reawakened and became a Player.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Jin-Woo was reawakened as a Player after surviving the Cartenon Temple and completing the secret quest "Courage of the Weak". The mysterious System has allowed Jin-Woo to limitless level up and increases his strength, unlike all hunters,
            who are unable to increase their strength unless reawakened.</p>

            <p> Jin-Woo was a young man of average height with long black hair and grey eyes; his build was frail, and despite being considered stronger than an ordinary human, he was the weakest among Hunters. Before the D-Rank Dungeon Incident, he
              wore a gray hoodie and brown undershirt alongside blue jeans.</p>

            <p>After his Reawakening as a Player, he grew a few inches taller; his facial features became a lot sharper, and he gained a lean/muscular build. His whole demeanor also became more serious and intimidating. When fighting enemies or when
              in use of his powers, Jin-Woo's eyes glow of a pale blue. In some cases, an ominous aura seeps from Jin-Woo alongside dark lightning.</p>

              and were
              killed by the statues when they were trying to escape. This also makes him slightly cautious as he hesitated to reveal his growing strength until he was sure he could protect his family.</p>

              threat and is rarely
              angered. He has displayed less emotion, which may be caused by the use of the system as mentioned by <span>Jin-Woo</span> himself when he states, "One of my emotions died," referring to the possibility that the power of the System is
              affecting him
              in some way. Despite this, he rarely questions the System and its unknown origins, which are later explained in the story. He also tends to smile when facing a difficult situation and always maintains the confidence of himself coming
